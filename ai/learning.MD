### Podcast episode: Exploring AI Impact on Code Generation and Quality

JavaScript Jabber podcast #618

- gen AI is rapidly increasing the amount of code produced increasing productivity
- code reviews are a bottleneck, and senior devs are critical to review code
- big companies often looking at how to do more with less and want ways to quantify the value of gen AI
- tools to reduce code review bottleneck include what Uber is doing to use gen AI to provide comments and context to developers doing code reviews
- Uber is also investing in sharing tests as artefacts with gen AI to try to help it develop more tests and tests for the future, including for edge cases.
- dev teams that are productive tend to be happier
- need to manage risks of hallucinations and security concerns (e.g. IP) when using gen AI or giving it permissions

### Tool use: Replit App Builder from Prompts

Replit site

- Replit is a free-to-try subscription based online AI agent that allows you to build websites through prompts. They take care of hosting and building the code.
- It shows a lot of promise in what a great version of this could be like, but even with coding knowledge as a prompter you can't avoid it making mistakes.
- It is definitely not good at mind-reading, especially when handling data.
- I was disappointed with its understanding of how to implement basic functionality (eg adding habit trackers), but impressed with its speed of execution and the developer experience on the website (at least while everything is working fine).
- I see users online talking about challenges with more advanced features like authentication where it seems to near-completely fail.
- A responsive customer service team online seems like a great and much needed feature if they want to retain customers in the long term. In the short term though, it seems they are making sales (albeit to many unhappy customers). They are currently offering $1000 prizes to people making good sites on Replit.
