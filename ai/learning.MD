### Podcast episode: Exploring AI Impact on Code Generation and Quality

JavaScript Jabber podcast #618

- gen AI is rapidly increasing the amount of code produced increasing productivity
- code reviews are a bottleneck, and senior devs are critical to review code
- big companies often looking at how to do more with less and want ways to quantify the value of gen AI
- tools to reduce code review bottleneck include what Uber is doing to use gen AI to provide comments and context to developers doing code reviews
- Uber is also investing in sharing tests as artefacts with gen AI to try to help it develop more tests and tests for the future, including for edge cases.
- dev teams that are productive tend to be happier
- need to manage risks of hallucinations and security concerns (e.g. IP) when using gen AI or giving it permissions
