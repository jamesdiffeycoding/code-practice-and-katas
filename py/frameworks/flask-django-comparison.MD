### Flask and Django

Flask is lightweight and allows you to create web projects with multiple routes and inject values into a template. It uses the Requests library for handling requests.

Django is heavier weight and better for full-stack apps with authentication or an ORM. It has these features out of the box.

Django has some features that you may never use, which can require wasted space on servers.

Flask is like building a house from scratch, while Django is like building a pre-built mansion.
