### Windsurf AI and Cursor AI

These are both AI agent IDEs that can build apps from your prompts and are very effective, though they can be buggy (e.g., if there are updates to the underlying AI pieces, such as Claude, that temporarily mean context is not passed correctly).

They typically take your app suggestion and break down tasks to complete, checking with you along the way to help ensure they're on the right track.

They can produce very impressive results, though their performance with pre-programmed suggestions is undoubtedly more reliable than with suggestions you come up with.

Regardless, developer knowledge is great for helping you understand what the tools are doing, what bugs they may be experiencing, and whether they are doing anything silly, and so on.

They can even work with databases and authentication, though I don't fully understand how they work or what integrations with cloud service providers are.

### Replit - App Builder from Prompts

Replit site

- Replit is a free-to-try, subscription-based online AI agent that allows you to build websites through prompts. They take care of hosting and building the code.
- It shows a lot of promise in what a great version of this could be like, but even with coding knowledge as a prompter, you can't avoid it making mistakes.
- It is definitely not good at mind-reading, especially when handling data.
- I was disappointed with its understanding of how to implement basic functionality (e.g., adding habit trackers), but impressed with its speed of execution and the developer experience on the website (at least while everything is working fine).
- I was also impressed that it knew to ask me things like, "Do you want email reminders, analytics, or a dashboard?"
- I see users online talking about challenges with more advanced features like authentication, where it seems to near-completely fail.
- A responsive customer service team online seems like a great and much-needed feature if they want to retain customers in the long term. In the short term, though, it seems they are making sales (albeit to many unhappy customers). They are currently offering $1000 prizes to people making good sites on Replit.

### Video notes: Is AI going to take jobs?

Yes and no.

- Yes, because it is true that with AI help, engineers can be more efficient. Four engineers with +25% efficiency can take the place of a fifth engineer.
- No, because engineers still need to understand the codebase enough to do the prompting and to sense-check everything.
- Yes, if AI continues to improve (note that billions are being invested into it by the biggest companies in the world). The endpoint is clearly stated: English prompts being fully 100% converted into code. You'd have prompter jobs and no developers, except in times of errors in this extreme case.
- You won't go far if you don't understand the code.

AI will fit into and help shape the engineering workflow. In the most extreme case, it can generate tickets, make code edits, test them, comment on them, and make pull requests.

One perspective is that if mega apps could be built by AI entirely, we'd have serious problems in the world. On the other hand, as AI improves in general, the level of problems people need to solve changes.

Some say we won't have fewer developers in the long run, just bigger ideas.

Some juniors are not set up for success. With high workloads, they may feel pressured to do too much and not feel they have the time or space to avoid AI. They must protect their own learning.
