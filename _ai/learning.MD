### Podcast Episode: Exploring AI Impact on Code Generation and Quality

JavaScript Jabber Podcast #618

- Gen AI is rapidly increasing the amount of code produced, boosting productivity.
- Code reviews are a bottleneck, and senior developers are critical for reviewing code.
- Big companies are often looking at how to do more with less and want ways to quantify the value of Gen AI.
- Tools to reduce the code review bottleneck include what Uber is doing with Gen AI to provide comments and context to developers during code reviews.
- Uber is also investing in sharing tests as artifacts with Gen AI to help it develop more tests and tests for the future, including edge cases.
- Developer teams that are productive tend to be happier.
- There is a need to manage the risks of hallucinations and security concerns (e.g., IP) when using Gen AI or giving it permissions.

### Are AI wrapper companies risky? video

- Foundational LLMs
  - the rocket science
  - billions of dollars
  - neural networks
  - years of training on data
  - big companies unlikely to acquire the wrapper companies as its easy to replicate with some savvy and market understanding.
- Wrapper companies
  - risky if someoneâ€™s model changes or gets worse (some say chatgpt is getting worse?)
    - beholden to pricing structure
    - they could disrupt your industry
  - these companies do best to stay well aware of changes to the foundational LLM, including the plugin communities around them e.g. GTP PLUS
    - built-in AI for instance into Microsoft Office / Excel / Word are likely to make some wrapper companies obsolete.
